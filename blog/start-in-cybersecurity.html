            <br />
            <p class="author-note-text">
              Cybersecurity is a vast world, and we’re going to briefly talk about 5 areas that are among the most popular—and how different they are from one another.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="mono author-note-text">
              <span>&#9654;</span> Blue Team
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="author-note-text">
              Let’s start by talking about the Blue Team, which is defined by one word: “Defense.” This team is responsible for protecting and monitoring a company’s infrastructure using various tools. They typically begin by learning about computer networks and operating systems, and then, depending on their area of interest, they dive deeper into topics like SIEM, endpoint security, or digital forensics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="author-note-text">
              There are many ways to train for this team: you can study through a technical degree or a bachelor's in computer science, use learning platforms like Coursera or Udemy, and explore different areas until you find your specific interest—whether it's networks, cloud, AI, or many others that may come your way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="mono author-note-text">
              <span>&#9654;</span> Red Team
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="author-note-text">
              The Red Team is probably the most popular—it's the one that, when you ask someone unfamiliar with the field, they’ll say, “Oh, so you’re a hacker?” Well, kind of. A person working on the Red Team usually has a more technical and hands-on profile. They use many different tools and can specialize in various areas. Having a solid understanding of operating systems is extremely valuable, as many of the tools used by penetration testers or ethical hackers come pre-installed in certain Linux distributions like Kali.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="author-note-text">
              The way this team works can vary, but often a company hires you as a Penetration Tester—one of the key roles—tasked with trying to exploit vulnerabilities in an application, for example, and reporting any findings to the company’s security team. Your job is basically to break things and report them, attempting to infiltrate systems depending on the level of access you're given to the infrastructure.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="author-note-text">
              To prepare for this role, it’s always a good idea to complement your undergraduate or technical degree, but what's most important is consistent hands-on practice. Fortunately, there are excellent platforms for this, such as TryHackMe (which offers a broader view of cybersecurity) and HackTheBox, which in my opinion is the best platform if hacking is what truly excites you.  
            </p>

            <p class="mono author-note-text">
              <span>&#9654;</span> Purple Team
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="author-note-text">
              The Purple Team is a combination of the Blue and Red Teams, and it’s a relatively new concept in cybersecurity. It’s not as common as the other two, but it’s gaining popularity. The idea is to have a team that can both defend and attack, allowing for a more comprehensive approach to security.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="author-note-text">
              If this is your area of interest, it’s better to start with one of the two teams mentioned earlier, since the Purple Team isn’t a common entry-level role and is usually taken on once you’re already working within a company. So, focus on mastering either the Blue or Red Team first, and once you’ve gained some experience, you can consider moving into the Purple Team.

            <br />
            <p class="author-note-text">
              Security Engineering is a more specialized area that focuses on designing and implementing security systems. It’s a great option if you enjoy working with hardware and software, and it’s a field that’s always in demand.

            <br>
            <p class="author-note-text">
              To prepare for this role, it’s essential to have a solid understanding of computer networks and operating systems, as well as experience with programming languages like Python or C++. Additionally, having a background in electrical engineering or computer science can be beneficial.

            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="author-note-text">
              GRC (Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance) is a critical area in cybersecurity that focuses on ensuring organizations meet legal and regulatory requirements while managing risks effectively. This field is ideal for those who have strong analytical skills and a keen interest in policy and compliance.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="author-note-text">
              To prepare for a career in GRC, it’s essential to have a solid understanding of the legal and regulatory landscape, as well as experience with risk management frameworks. Many professionals in this field have backgrounds in law, business, or public policy, and certifications like Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) or Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) can be beneficial.
